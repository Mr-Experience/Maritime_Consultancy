## 🚀 Next Steps

2.  **Deployment**: Upload to hosting server.
3.  **Content Population**: (Optional) Replace placeholder images with actual client assets if available.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

-   **Forms**: The contact and newsletter forms are frontend-only. They need to be connected to a backend service (like PHP mailer or Formspree) to actually send emails.
-   **Translations**: The language selector is functional but currently relies on a limited set of placeholder translations in the JS. Full translation strings need to be populated for production use in non-English markets.
